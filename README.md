# ðŸ“– Description

ðŸ’» **Windows, Linux and Mac compatible.** ðŸ’»

A Python script to track time spent on various projects. This script allows you to start, stop, and monitor time tracking for different projects, as well as output data to files.

It is very lightweight since it doesnt have to be running in the background.

This script is going to help you track:
- Total time spent on different projects
- Work sessions information
- Time spent on each session

# ðŸš€ Quick start

```bash
pipx install hourtrack
hourtrack start myProject
```

- **Supports multiple projects**: Track time for multiple projects.
- **Start/Stop tracking**: Start and stop tracking time for a project.
- **List projects**: List all projects being tracked.
- **Delete project**: Delete a project and all its data.
- **Reset project**: Reset a project's data.
- **Export data**: Export data to a `.txt` file.
- ...

From [PyPI][PyPiLink]

```bash
pipx install hourtrack
```
_`pipx` is optional but recommended, you can use `pip` instead._

**Optional installation alternative**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/P-ict0/HourTrack.git
cd HourTrack
pipx install .  # You can also use `pip`
```

# ðŸ“² Usage

For help:
```bash
hourtrack --help

**(Optional) Create a project**:
Create a project to start tracking time. (This is not necessary, as the project will be created when you start tracking time for it.)
```bash
hourtrack create <project>
```

**Start tracking**:
Start tracking session for a project. If the project does not exist, it will be created.
```bash
hourtrack start <project>
```

**Stop tracking**:
Stop current session for a project, saving the time spent. With option to delete all projects.
```bash
hourtrack stop <project|--all>
```

**Reset project**:
Reset a project's data. With option to reset all projects

```bash
hourtrack reset <project|--all>
```

**Edit project**:
Rename a project.
```bash
hourtrack edit <project> --rename <new_name>
```

Add session with endtime now that lasted certain number of hours.
```bash
hourtrack edit <project> --add-session <hours>
```

Delete session by its ID. (You get the id by `hourtrack info <project>`)
```bash
hourtrack edit <project> --delete-session <id>
# Delete last session
hourtrack edit <project> --delete-session -1
```

**Delete project**:
Delete a project and all its data. With option to delete all projects.

```bash
hourtrack delete <project|--all>
```

**List projects**:
List all/active projects.

```bash
hourtrack list <all|active> [--format <smart|full|short|hours>]
```

**Project Info**:
